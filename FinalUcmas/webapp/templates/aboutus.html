      <div class="card-body">
          <h6 class="text-white">UCMAS is much more than just developing number skills. Using Math as a medium and Abacus as a tool, this program will help develop basic cognitive skills and cognitive executive functions of your child. Cognitive skills are the core skills your brain uses to think, read, learn, remember, reason, and pay attention. Working together, they take incoming information and move it into the bank of knowledge your child uses every day at school, and in life.
          UCMAS child development program uses an army of cognitive skill development techniques like:

        <h6 class="mt-5">This ensures that your child develops these skills rapidly in the first few years of life and build on them progressively throughout grade school. These crucial skills will enable your child to process sensory information and eventually learn to evaluate, analyze, remember, make comparisons and understand cause and effect. Although some cognitive skill development is related to a child’s genetic makeup, most cognitive skills are learned. That means thinking and learning skills can be improved with practice and the right training.</h6>

              <h5 class="ml-3" style="opacity:1 !important">It is scientifically proven that the more your fingers move, the more informed would be your brain. The fingertip peripheral nerve can affect our five major organs (as depicted in the image), referring to the five brain acupoints that correspond with the five organs. The position of different acupoints is reflected on the related distal of each fingertip, also is the specific path for children’s health cultivation.

Through our UCMAS programme, the fingers and the sharp edges of abacus beads can be easily stimulated often by scrubbing to activate and strengthen the functions of five major organs and cerebral cortex.

The 6 – Finger Manipulation, 10 – Finger Activation system, helps in the enhancement of the operation of the cerebral cortex. One of its many benefits is that it helps the Right Middle Finger to stimulate the Left parietal lobe. </h5>
